<h1>  Hey, it’s Bless.  4/27-28/22</h1>
<p class="subtitle">I don’t wanna be a  (ShrIMP) but I miss you lmaoo. It’s not like we talked a lot on the phone , or even at allll reallyyy but the idea that I can’t just call/Text you whenever is kinda trippy. Anyways im probably just exaggerating for the “art”. So I realized I haven’t entirely introduced myself yet, my name is Benicio Aurora. Benicio in Latin mostly translates to blessed. Which is pretty much how I got bless.I’m roughly around your age hahahaha (What’s funny is that my birthday was on my Twitter for a while and I didn’t know). I like long walks on the beach and and and, okay that’s a joke, but if I do fuck with the beach. I live in LA, I remember I had this old lady try teach me how to surf but I had to teach her to skate, it was pretty fun. Anyways i hope your auction today pops off, lmao I was in another space yesterday with a bunch of artist and I talked about it again   and honestly might keep doing it to at least get them eyes on it. I actually used you as an example to show that there’s different things artist can do to get a deeper connection with collectors than just spamming their auction under replies or whatever.Ngl I hope I get to hear your voice again soon. I really did enjoy your singing, oh shit speaking of singing I have an invite that you have 24 hours to accept it's at the top of the page im hoping it works if not ahaha we have to figure something else out. It's a spotify collab playlist
    Idk how you’re gonna be able to do it but Um if you save this picture on your iPhone maybe it’ll pop up ? Ah shit I might have to just make a mini website NFT , fuck. 
Also im really proud of you! Your auction did great !!! 
Also this is really hard Ahaha I wanted to talk to you today and shit like randomly just but fuck. Also the space i invited you to in was the auction Haus like at the time of me inviting you and then it turned into just chill degen talk with my friends.
ngl i kinda smiled a lil when i saw you pop up :) ok ok ok anyways damn , hopfully the spotify link works and hmm damn i hope your arms are less sore. with lve - bless
